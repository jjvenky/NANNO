Description: NANNO creates a nitrogen isotope biogeochemical model
    for use in freshwaters via the simecol package. NANNO can be used
    to forward simulate changes in nitrogen concentrations and isotopic
    ratios. NANNO can also be used iteratively to model-fit field data.
    NANNO was initially developed to describe changes in nitrogen
    concentrations and isotopic ratios in a wastewater treatment plant
    plumes in rivers.
